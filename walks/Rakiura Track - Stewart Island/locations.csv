"Gallon's Sawmill","The Rakiura Track runs past a number of old sawmill sites that once dotted the island's coastline. The first sawmill was built here in 1861 when Gallon dammed the small stream that flows into the head of Kaipipi Inlet to direct water into a race to a waterwheel to power his saw. No structures remain today, but there is still evidence of the rock lined pit where the waterwheel once stood and onsite interpretation tells the story of this mill.

"Kaipipi Bay","Today this is a tranquil picnic spot, but not so in the late 1800s - early 1900s when a long bridge and tramline spanned the Kaipipi shallows to allow saw millers to tap into the centuries old rimu which was the preferred timber for furniture and buildings.

"Lee Bay","Look for the anchor chain sculpture, which marks the entrance to Rakiura National Park and the beginning of the track. The sculpture signifies that Stewart Island/Rakiura is the anchor stone of Maui's canoe in Maori legend.","Generic POI","168.123255","-46.863308"," "," "
"Maori Beach","Site of early Maori kaika (Maori village) at Peter's Point and an area of significant sawmilling & logging from 1913 - 1931. The wharf, mill houses and school are long gone - abandoned machinery and tramlines are all that remain of the once thriving community.","Historic site","168.080625","-46.852697"," "," "
"Port William / Potirepo","Port William is a nice sheltered harbour and has been the site of a range of commercial industries over the years, from fishing, mining and farming to even a small Gold Rush. Rakiura tokoeka/kiwi can be heard and sometimes seen in this area.","Generic POI","168.0822659","-46.83753322"," "," "
"Historic Log Haulers","Take a breather at the log haulers, remnants of a bygone era when these massive machines were used to drag the forest giants from the depths of the gullies and hillsides. ","Historic site","168.0686","-46.8456"," "," "
"North Arm Hut","North Arm hut looks out over a large tidal bay, at the head of Paterson Inlet, where wading birds may often be seen feeding at low tide.","Camphut","168.0184628","-46.88298688"," "," "
"Rakiura National Park Visitor Centre","A great place to get information on walking tracks around Halfmoon Bay and in Rakiura National Park. Hire locator beacons, purchase hut tickets, check the latest weather and get track updates. If it’s raining there is a fantastic range of videos about life on the island that you can watch.","VisitorCentre","168.126333","-46.898098"," ","30"
"Maori Beach Campsite and Shelter","After the mill closed in 1931 people gradually drifted away. Today the area is peaceful and picturesque, with regenerating forest quickly hiding evidence of those earlier days. Daffodils  as well as clumps of montbretia and bluebells can be seen - all that is left of the sawmill workers gardens.","Campsite","168.088","-46.8573","25","-5"
"Port William Hut","In 1873 a group of 24 settlers from the Orkney and Shetland Islands were enticed here to establish a town. The provincial government had built barracks for them as part of a special settlement scheme. But infertile soils, the lack of markets for fish and isolation were too much, and 18 months later the town was abandoned.","Hut","168.087106","-46.835717","-10","10"
"North Arm Campsite and Shelter","The campsite is surrounded by regenerating podocarp forest, including Rimu, Miro and totara. Rakiura tokoeka/kiwi can be heard and sometimes seen around the campsite.  The foreshore near the hut was an important food gathering (mahinga kai) site for early Maori.","Campsite","168.0181","-46.8832","25","25"
"Port William Campsite and Shelter","Archaeological evidence indicates that Maori were occupying sites on Rakiura as early as the 13th century. Many of these are on the eastern coastline including three in the Maori Beach/Pa Whakataka and Port William/Potirepo area. Magnetic Beach in front of the campsite is sheltered and along with Maori Beach/Pa Whakataka would have been a good seafood gathering area. The North West circuit track, the longest circuit track in New Zealand (125 km) continues from the back of the campsite.","Campsite","168.083769","-46.836618"," ","-30"
