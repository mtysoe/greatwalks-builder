    <h3>Nearest airports</h3>

    <p>Wanganui and Taupo Airports are about the same driving distance from the start of the shorter 3 day river journey in Whakahoro, approximately 2.5 hours. Canoe hire, drop off and secure parking are packaged together by tour operators. Some tour operators are based along the Whanganui River Road in Pipiriki, Raetihi and Ohakune and in this instance driving from Wanganui would be the best option. For those keen to complete the longer 5 day river journey driving from Taupo to Taumarunui is quicker, however this depends on where you hire your canoes.</p>
