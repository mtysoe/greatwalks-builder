    <p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

    <h3>
      Track safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Weather on the Heaphy Track is changeable with annual rainfall averaging over 4000 mm. Heavy rain can occur with little warning, and even small streams are dangerous in flood. Be prepared for rain, snow and wind, especially on the exposed sections of the track.        
      </li>
      <li>
        During winter, adverse weather can damage the track significantly. These areas will be marked by signage and warning tape, although you should check with the Nelson DOC Visitor Centre prior to your walk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sections of the coastal track are subject to large wave surges during high tides and rough seas—this may cause the track to be temporarily impassable. When planning your trip, ensure you check tide charts and allow adequate time in case of delays.
      </li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Plan and prepare

        A good level of fitness is required to walk the track. You can expect to walk up to 7 hours a day, depending on your fitness and weather conditions; and carry a pack of up to 15 kg for the whole length of the track.
      </li>
      <li>
        The right outdoor clothing, gear and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment of your trip. Pack all necessary equipment, your own food and drinks (including an extra day’s supply) and personal effects.

      You can walk the Heaphy Track all year. The most popular period is during the summer from Christmas through to Easter (December - April), however walking the track in autumn can be a good option as there are fewer people on the track and the weather is often calm and settled.

    <h3>
      Travelling with children
    </h3>

    <p>
      For those with limited time or families with young children we recommend completing a day walk or staying overnight at a hut to experience some of the track and spend time exploring.  A popular two-day, one-night trip starting from the western side of the track is from Kohaihai to Heaphy Hut, returning to Kohaihai. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The longest of the Great Walks at 78.4 km, to walk the whole of the Heaphy Track you will need to be fit and have good equipment. We recommend that walkers start a fitness programme at least two months before departure and practise carrying a full pack (15 kg) up and down stairs or hills. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a 4 day trip you can expect to walk up to 24 km per day or 21 km per day for a 5 day trip.
    </p>
