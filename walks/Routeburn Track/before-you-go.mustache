    <p>
      It is <b>important</b> to plan and prepare
      so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of the weather
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Take sufficient supplies
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      Track safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This track is not recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous environment and often adverse weather conditions. An overnight stay at Routeburn Flats, Routeburn Falls or Lake Howden huts is a suitable family option.</li>
      <li>Fiordland and Mount Aspiring National Parks lie in an area with high rainfall and changeable weather patterns. Cold temperatures, snow, strong winds and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year.</li>
      <li>While the track can be walked year round, outside of the Great Walks season (late October to late April), it is no longer classed as an easy tramping track due to additional risk factors (eg. avalanches), and walkers must have backcountry skills and experience.</li>
      <li>The Routeburn Track is complex avalanche terrain and the risk of avalanche can extend into December. During the Great Walks season DOC manages this risk to a low level and walkers may be flown (at their cost) over dangerous sections.</li>
      <li>While the track can be walked year round, in the off season (1 May – 27 October) facilities are reduced (e.g. bridges removed, no rangers on site, no radio connections, no hut wardens, no gas for cooking, water supply might be limited etc.) and visitors will need to be well equipped and experienced for winter conditions including the risk of avalanche, snow storms and limited daylight hours. DOC does not monitor hazards such as flooding or avalanche.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
      Plan and prepare
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Book your trip well in advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end of the track.
      </li>
      <li>
        Safety is your responsibility - leave your trip details with a trusted contact. See <a href="http://adventuresmart.org.nz/">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weather on the track is changeable, so be prepared and check the forecast before you go.
        See <a href="http://metservice.com">metservice.com</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        
         A good level of fitness is required to walk the track. You can expect to walk up to 6 hours a day, depending on your fitness and weather conditions; and carry a pack of up to 15 kg for the whole length of the track.

      </li>
      <li>
        The right outdoor clothing, gear and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment of your trip. Pack all necessary equipment, your own food and drinks (including an extra day’s supply) and personal effects.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Food and drinks are not available for purchase at Great Walks huts and campsites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      The best time to walk the Routeburn Track is from late October to late April when the weather is warmer and there are more regular transport services to and from the start and end of the track. During the off-peak season (May to October) the Routeburn Track remains open but is subject to weather, track and avalanche conditions. 
    </p>

    <h3>Travelling with children</h3>
    <p>
      The Routeburn Track is the perfect track for you, and your family and friends, if you love being amongst nature and want an exciting outdoors adventure on a track with excellent facilities. It also offers fantastic day walk opportunities for families or those with less time.
